All ships, including those of the military, are vulnerable to problems from weather conditions, faulty design or human error. Some of the disasters below occurred in periods of conflict, although their losses were unrelated to any military action. The table listings are in descending order of the magnitude of casualties suffered. Year Country Description Deaths Image 1694 England HMS Sussex – the third-rate was lost in a fierce storm on 1 March 1694 off Gibraltar. There were two survivors from a crew of 500. 498 1120  England White Ship – Ship carrying the heir to the English Throne and the Duchy of Normandy, and over 300 others. Drunk crew ran her aground in the English Channel. There were two survivors, and the loss caused 20 years of civil war over the English crown. 300 1647 Netherlands Princess Amelia – On 27 September 1647, Captain Bol mistook the Bristol Channel for the English Channel and ran her aground off the Mumbles, Wales where she broke apart. Of 107 passengers aboard, 21 survived. 86 Wartime disasters[edit] Disasters with high losses of life can occur in times of armed conflict. Shown below are some of the known events with major losses. Year Country Description Lives lost Image 1274 1281 Mongol Empire Kamikaze - The Mongol fleet destroyed in a typhoon. 100,000+ -253 !256 BCE 253 BCE Roman Republic First Punic War – In the First Punic War, between the Roman Republic and Carthage, a Roman fleet that had just rescued a Roman army from Africa was caught in a Mediterranean storm. Rome may have lost more than 90,000 men. 90,000+ 1588  Spain Spanish Armada – On 8 August 1588, Philip II of Spain sent the Armada to invade England. Spain lost 15,000–20,000 soldiers and sailors, mainly in storms rather than battle.[1] 15,000-20,000 1589  England English Armada – Also known as the Counter Armada or the Drake-Norris Expedition, was a fleet of warships sent to the Iberian Coast by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1589, during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) and the Eighty Years' War. It was led by Sir Francis Drake as admiral and Sir John Norreys as general, and failed to drive home the advantage England had won upon the dispersal of the Spanish Armada in the previous year. The campaign resulted in the defeat of the English fleet and eventually to a withdrawal with heavy losses both in lives and ships. 11,000-15,000 1588  Spain Girona – On 28 October 1588, as part of the Spanish Armada, the Spanish galleass Girona was sunk in a gale off Ireland. Of the estimated 1,300 people aboard, nine survived; 260 bodies were washed ashore. 1,300 1564  Sweden Mars – A Swedish warship that was sunk 18 kilometres north of Öland during the Northern Seven Years' War. The crown ship of King Eric XIV of Sweden's fleet. The gunpowder store exploded and up to 1,000 men, including Swedes and the invading Lübeckians, died.[2] 900-1100 1692  France Soleil-Royal – On 3 June 1692, in the Battle of La Hougue, the French flagship was attacked by 17 ships at Pointe du Hommet. She managed to repel them with artillery fire, but a fire ship set her stern afire and it soon reached her powder rooms. The people of Cherbourg came to the rescue, but there was only one survivor from 883–950 crew. 882-949 1676  Sweden Kronan – In the Battle of Öland in 1676, the warship capsized while turning. Gunpowder aboard ignited and exploded. Of the estimated 800 aboard, 42 survived. 758 1545  England Mary Rose – The warship sank in the Battle of the Solent on 19 July 1545. The cause is unknown, but believed to have been due to water entering her open gunports and capsizing her. About 500 people were lost. 480-520 1591  England HMS Revenge – After being captured in battle, the English galleon was lost in a storm near the Azores in 1591. An estimated 200 Spanish sailors who captured her were lost. 200 1678  France Las Aves disaster – on 11 May 1678 a French fleet under Adm. Jean II d'Estrées was wrecked on the Las Aves archipelago due to an error in navigation. Nine of the fleets 30 ships were lost.

<TEXT> 2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search 2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck Lampedusa Malta 2013 Lampedusa migrant shipwreck (Mediterranean) Date 3, 11 October 2013 Location Lampedusa, Malta Cause Vessels capsized Participants Over 500 Deaths (360 estimated; 359 confirmed[1]) Location of Lampedusa island On 3 October 2013, a boat carrying migrants from Libya to Italy sank off the Italian island of Lampedusa. It was reported that the boat had sailed from Misrata, Libya, but that many of the migrants were originally from Eritrea, Somalia and Ghana.[2][3][4] An emergency response involving the Italian Coast Guard resulted in the rescue of 155 survivors.[3] On 12 October it was reported that the confirmed death toll after searching the boat was 359, but that further bodies were still missing;[5] a figure of "more than 360" deaths was later reported.[1] A second shipwreck occurred 120 kilometres (75 mi) from Lampedusa on 11 October, within the Maltese search and rescue zone, but closer to Lampedusa.[5][6] The boat was reportedly carrying migrants from Syria and Palestine, and at least 34 individuals were later confirmed dead.[5][6] Contents 1 3 October incident 2 Reaction 3 Shipwreck of 11 October 4 See also 5 References 3 October incident[edit] Aerial view of Lampedusa; north is to the left of the image. It was initially reported that over five hundred people were on board the 20-metre-long (66 ft) fishing boat when it began to have engine trouble less than a quarter-mile from Lampedusa, causing the ship to begin sinking. In an attempt to contact nearby boats, a blanket on the ship was lit on fire. However, this fire grew worse when it ignited some gasoline and began to engulf the boat before it sank.[2][3] To avoid the flames, many people threw themselves into the water or moved away from the fire to the same part of the ship, which then capsized.[3][7] At least 350 people were initially declared missing.[8] On 7 October, it was reported that 194 bodies had been recovered, and that the final death toll could rise to between 325 and 363 individuals. A total of 155 people had been rescued. A further 108 bodies were reported retrieved by 9 October, after access was gained to the inside of the boat's hull, resting some 47 metres (154 ft) beneath the surface of the water.[9][10][11] On 11 October, it was reported that all bodies had been recovered from the boat, and the confirmed death toll had reached 339. About 50 were believed to be still missing, and searches for further bodies in the area would continue using aircraft and robotic devices.[12] A further 20 bodies had been found by 12 October, bringing the total to 359.[5] The total number of dead was later reported as "more than 360".[1] On 8 November, it was reported that that the migrants had each paid at least $3,000 (£1,866) to the Libyan, Somali and Sudanese trafficking group before making the sea crossing from Libya.[1][13] Women who were unable to pay were said to have been raped, and men who rebelled were tied up and tortured.[13] The alleged captain of the boat, a 35-year-old Tunisian named as Khaled Bensalam, who was reported to have been deported from Italy in April 2013, was arrested under suspicion of being responsible for the sinking.[14] It was reported that he could be charged with manslaughter.[15] On 8 November, a 34-year-old Somali national, Mouhamud Elmi Muhidin, and a Palestinian man, Attour Abdalmenem, were also arrested under suspicion of having been among the traffickers that organized the voyage. Police indicated that Muhidin was facing a series of charges, including people trafficking, kidnapping, sexual assault, and criminal association with the aim of abetting illicit immigration. The two men were detained by the Italian police after a number of the shipwreck survivors spotted and began attacking them.[16] Reaction[edit] Pope Francis of the Roman Catholic Church tweeted "pray [to] God for the victims of the shipwreck off Lampedusa,"[2] while Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta tweeted that it was "an immense tragedy".[3] António Guterres, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, commended the Italian Coast Guard for their quick reaction to the disaster.[3] The Italian Government launched Operation Mare Nostrum in order to avoid new tragedies. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Angelino Alfano stated that the incident highlighted the need for European assistance to handle the continuing influx of refugees, declaring the shipwreck "a European tragedy, not just an Italian one[...] The toll is unfortunately a tragic one".[17] A national day of mourning was also announced in Italy.[7] In response to the deaths, Cecilia Malmström, European Commissioner for Home Affairs, called for the European Union to increase their Mediterranean-wide search and rescue patrols to intercept migrant boats, through the Frontex border agency.[15] She said: "Let's make sure that what happened in Lampedusa will be a wakeup call to increase solidarity and mutual support and to prevent similar tragedies in the future."[18] José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, and Italian Prime Minister Letta visited Lampedusa on 9 October. Letta announced that a state funeral would be held for the migrants who died, and Barroso said that 30 million euros would be used to help refugees in Italy.[10] Shipwreck of 11 October[edit] 11 October shipwreck Date 11 October 2013 Location Off Malta Mediterranean Cause Vessel capsized Participants 200 Outcome Vessel sank, 147 rescued[5][6] Deaths 34 confirmed A second shipwreck occurred on 11 October, 120 kilometres (75 mi) from Lampedusa within the territorial waters of Malta. Reports the following day stated that 34 were confirmed dead; initial unconfirmed reports of at least 50 bodies appeared to be exaggerated. The boat was carrying over 200 migrants, reportedly from Syria and Palestine, and capsized when people on board moved to one side of the vessel as they tried to get the attention of a passing aircraft. The rescue operation was coordinated by the Maltese authorities, with the assistance of some of the Italian vessels involved after 3 October shipwreck at Lampedusa. Some 147 survivors were taken to Malta, and a further 56 were taken to Italy.[5][6] According to some of the Syrian migrants, the boat was fired upon by Libyan militiamen during a trafficking gang dispute.[19] After the second shipwreck, the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, complained of a lack of action from other European countries on the problem of migration across the sea, and said: "As things stand we are building a cemetery within our Mediterranean Sea."[5] United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the international community as a whole "to take action to prevent such tragedies in the future, including measures that address their root causes and that places the vulnerability and human rights of migrants at the centre of the response."[20] On 8 November, Italian police arrested a 47-year-old Palestinian man, Attour Abdalmenem, for having allegedly been among the traffickers that organized the voyage.[13] See also[edit] Lampedusa immigrant reception center 2009 Mediterranean Sea migrant shipwreck 2011 Mediterranean Sea migrant shipwreck 2014 Libya migrant shipwreck 2015 Mediterranean Sea migrant shipwreck References[edit] ^ a b c d "Lampedusa boat tragedy: Migrants 'raped and tortured'".

The programme plans to target refugee boats and involves a massive expansion of intelligence and police powers.The first phase of the operation is to begin within days. It involves intelligence agency spying on alleged smuggling organisations and networks in North Africa, particularly Libya.Agents are to locate targets and identify boats and suspected masterminds, before forwarding this data to the command centre. With this information, refugee boats will be intercepted, confiscated and destroyed on the high seas in the second phase of the operation. The third stage allegedly involves the deployment of Predator drones, Tornado fighter jets and military divers on the coast and in Libyan ports.The military operation is a response to the tragic shipwrecks off the Italian island of Lampedusa earlier this year, in which over 1,200 refugees drowned in a matter of days, attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. It is indicative of the character of the EU that it has responded to the humanitarian catastrophe of mass deaths by stepping up the militarisation of the Mediterranean. With the state funding of EUNAVFOR Med, the EU is officially declaring war on refugees.A total of ten EU member states are participating in the operation, providing five warships, two submarines, drones, fighter jets and helicopters. The fleet will be led by the Italian aircraft carrier Cavour, and the operation is commanded by Italian rear admiral Enrico Credendino.The EU’s foreign affairs representative, Federica Mogherini, said after the EU foreign ministers’ meeting, “The EU has never taken the issue of migration as seriously as we are doing now.” She could just as well have said that the EU had never done so much to prevent refugees from reaching Europe.The latest annual report of the UN agency for refugees finds nearly 60 million refugees worldwide. More than half of these are children. But instead of accepting a small fraction of this total, the EU seals its borders and is sending an armada of warships against them.German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told journalists that the issue was to “get an overview of the flow of refugees, where they are coming from and who possibly are the decisive actors.”In reality, he knows this very well. It was mainly the European powers in alliance with US imperialism which led wars against Afghanistan and Iraq, triggered a horrendous civil war in Syria, and left chaos in Libya, unleashing a tidal wave of victims attempting to flee. Their neocolonial policies of exploitation in Africa are forcing additional hundreds of thousands to leave their countries of origin in an effort to secure the survival of their families in Europe.The EU passes over these facts without a word. Mogherini said, “With this operation, we are targeting the business model of those who benefit from the misery of migrants.” The real target was not refugees, she claimed, but “those who are making money on their lives and too often on their deaths.” Rather than save refugees at sea and admit them into Europe, the EU has launched a struggle against alleged organised smuggling networks. The refugees are to be kept out at all costs.There is a dishonest confusion of cause and effect in this policy. The unscrupulous smugglers are the only means for refugees to bypass the walls of the impregnable fortress Europe. The multi-million-euro smuggling business is the direct result of the policy of sealing the EU’s borders ever more tightly.At the same time EU powers are using the military operation to strengthen and coordinate their intelligence agencies. The official justification for the deployment of intelligence agencies and the military in the first phase is more than questionable, because the information to be collected on methods of work, routes, business model and financial transactions of the smuggler organisations is already captured by the Eurosur surveillance scheme.In truth, under cover of the surveillance of alleged smuggler networks, the EU is working to integrate various security agencies. EUNAVFOR Med is not merely a naval exercise in the Mediterranean, but involves the closer integration of the intelligence agencies, military, police and the EU border agency Frontex.French President François Hollande agreed to the participation of French intelligence in a joint operation with Italy and Britain. An intelligence agency base is to be constructed on Sicily tasked with monitoring smuggler networks, under the control of the European police authority Europol. Britain’s National Crime Agency is sending six agents. Britain has also announced the sending of the warship HMS Enterprise to the Mediterranean, with a team of agents from GCHQ.Already in March, the Joint Operations Team Mare (JOT Mare) was established, including Germany’s federal crime agency (BKA). This is an operational group of Europol, which is to investigate smuggler networks through intelligence-gathering activities and collaborate closely with Frontex.According to the Geneva Convention on Refugees, police authorities are supposed to protect refugees. In order to integrate police into the military operation in spite of this, a sleight of hand has been used. The smuggling of refugees across the Mediterranean was recently declared, in spite of knowledge to the contrary, to be “organised crime.” The claim is that organised criminals compel refugees to travel across the Mediterranean to Europe. But nothing could be further from the truth. The British-based Guardian quoted the researcher Tuesday Reitano, who is currently working on an OECD (Organisation for Co-operation and Development) project on refugees, saying, “There are few, if any, ‘kingpins’ or formal criminal networks at play that would significantly impact the flow if removed.”But since the EU has declared the smuggling of refugees to be organised crime, data can be collected and evaluated by Europol, something Frontex would not be allowed to do. In addition, the Eurodac database for police investigations was opened. The fingerprints of refugees and a vast amount of other information are saved there.The close integration of the civil European authorities like Frontex, Europol and Eurojust with the military raises fundamental legal issues. In Germany, for example, there is a constitutional guarantee of the separation of the police and military. Since, from the standpoint of international law, the smuggling of refugees is a private criminal act, it can only be combatted through police investigation. The participation of the German army in the operation in the Mediterranean and the merging of the police, intelligence agencies and military are thus a violation of German basic law.The planned phases two and three of the EU military mission carry “a high risk of collateral damage and the loss of human life,” the EU Commission admitted when the plans for EUNAVFOR were presented.A high-ranking Italian military official told EUObserver that the entire operation would be condemned to failure if one did not explicitly accept the possibility that refugees would die. He stated, “When it comes to destroying smugglers’ boats, they’ll simply put migrants on them, even when they’re at anchor, to act as human shields.” Despite this, EU governments are sticking firmly to the criminal plan of using warships, fighter jets and drones to destroy smugglers’ boats.The refugee defence organisation ProAsyl considers the operation to be in violation of international law, because the UN mandate being sought by the EU to give it a blank check for its military operation requires, according to article 39 of the UN charter, that there be a threat to peace.ProAsyl wrote: “The EU foreign affairs representative has constructed this threat by suggesting that the high levels of refugees are supposedly destabilising EU states. This argument cannot be accepted under international law. The acceptance of refugees is an obligation under international law and not a danger to peace.”   Commenting Discussion Rules » Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The Dignity 1 ship, ran by aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, returned the migrants to port, raising the total number of migrants rescued in the last 24 hours to over 2,500. One body, believed to be that of a migrant killed during a shooting incident off the Libyan coast, was brought to shore before the other migrants disembarked. Another migrant was injured by a gunshot wound to the calf and taken to the island of Lampedusa for treatment. Foreign ministers across the European Union agreed on 22 June to launch a naval operation against gangs smuggling migrants to Europe from Libya. The mission will be solely intelligence-gathering for now, until given authority by the United Nations.

Their movement caused the large, multilevel boat to capsize about 110 kilometers (almost 70 miles) north of Libya, sending the desperate crowd plunging into the sea, their chance of survival slim. The migrant, who spoke to investigators after being airlifted to a hospital in Catania, is among dozens who authorities say were saved from the sinking vessel. He told investigators there were 950 people on board -- a number prosecutors haven't verified. Maltese authorities, who are working with Italian rescuers, earlier said around 50 of 700 people on the boat had been saved. Many on lower levels of the boat were trapped inside because smugglers had locked the doors, the migrant said, according to prosecutors. The Italian Coast Guard is collecting statements from other survivors, prosecutors said.It was the latest in a series of dangerous voyages for hundreds of men, women and children who boarded the boat in Libya, hoping to make it safely to Europe. Passengers on the boat were from a number of nations, including Algeria, Egypt, Somalia, Niger, Senegal, Mali, Zambia, Bangladesh and Ghana, prosecutors said.While the shipwreck was an accident, Malta's Prime Minister slammed the human traffickers who he accused of risking people's lives by putting them on rickety ships in unpredictable waters."Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat, sometimes even at gunpoint," Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said. "They're putting them on the road to death, really, and nothing else."It's "genocide -- nothing less than genocide, really," Muscat told CNN. Like a 'war zone'United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said that the incident could be worse than an incident last week in which 400 refugees and migrants died in the Mediterranean. "Our troops, together with the Italian navy, are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive," Muscat said of the latest incident at sea.Flavio Di Giacomo, spokesman for the International Organization for Migration, told CNN that survivors were taken to Sicily.The Italian Coast Guard, which is leading the rescue operation, reported that at least 24 bodies had been recovered so far at the shipwreck site.Security for Libya's borders is essential to "take out these criminal gangs -- these terrorists," Muscat said. The international community "cannot continue to turn a blind eye," he added.The leader of the international nonpartisan medical organization Doctors Without Borders had strong words Sunday for the tragedy. "A mass grave is being created in the Mediterranean Sea and European policies are responsible," said the group's president, Loris De Filippi. He compared the high number of deaths to "figures from a war zone." De Filippi called on European states to immediately launch large-scale search-and-rescue operations with proactive patrolling as close as possible to Libyan shores. "Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea," he said. "This tragedy is only just beginning, but it can and should be stopped." Doctors Without Borders will begin its own rescue effort, he added, because "as a medical, humanitarian organization, we simply cannot wait any longer."EU: 'Moral and humanitarian obligation to act'French President Francois Hollande called for the European Union to help more in the rescue.If the deaths are in the hundreds, he said, the accident could be "the worst disaster in recent years in the Mediterranean."Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi called an emergency Cabinet meeting in Rome. Speaking to journalists later, he defended Italy's response. "Adding 10 more vessels" to patrol the Mediterranean, Renzi said, wouldn't solve the root of why the tragedy occurred. "This has to be clear: there was not an absence (of rescue vessels) which led to the disaster. And this is the proof that if you want to eradicate the problem from the root, you have to respond in a different way. And what we're doing in the next few hours will show this." Renzi said the focus needs to be on eradicating human trafficking and that the responsibility lies with the whole world, "not just Italy and Malta." Human Rights Watch urged the EU to act quickly. "The EU is standing by with arms crossed while hundreds die off its shores," said Judith Sunderland, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. "These deaths might well have been prevented if the EU had launched a genuine search-and-rescue effort."The EU released a statement Sunday saying that it planned action down the road but didn't detail any immediate plans to help with the search for the victims of this accident. "The European Commission is deeply chagrined by the tragic developments in the Mediterranean today, but also over the past days and weeks. The reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold. These are human lives at stake, and the European Union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act," it said. The EU is consulting member states, European agencies and international organizations to prepare what it called a European Migration Strategy, which would be adopted in middle May. It stressed the need to "address the situation at its roots.""And as long as countries of origin and transit do not take action to prevent these desperate trips, people will continue to put their lives at risk," the statement read. Desperate journeysMany of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean are from sub-Saharan Africa, and travel for weeks just to get to the ships. They're seeking a better life, but many are exploited by the traffickers who organize the voyages.Already this year, more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean -- far more than during the same period in 2014, the International Organization for Migration said Friday.In one four-day period alone, more than 8,000 migrants were rescued, according to the Italian Coast Guard. On one day alone, SOS calls came in from 20 boats in distress.Roberta Metsola, a Maltese member of the European Parliament, told CNN on Sunday that countries from Northern Europe need to share the responsibility with their southern neighbors."The people are going to continue to arrive," she said. "The desperation subsists -- there are almost a million people waiting to board boats and come to Europe to seek a better life. And that fact has to be recognized."Journalist Barbie Nadeau and CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome; CNN's Jethro Mullen reported Hong Kong, and CNN's Ashley Fantz, Josh Levs, Catherine E.

<HEAD> Sea Migrants: A Humanitarian Crisis | In Homeland Security </HEAD>
<TEXT> In Homeland Security News & Analysis of Critical Issues in Terrorism & Homeland Defense Navigation Home Top NavHome About the Blog Categories Contributors Partnerships Newsletter Blogroll Return to Content Migrants at Sea: A Growing Humanitarian Crisis By Glynn Cosker on June 17, 2015 in Commentary and Analysis, Email Newsletter, Global News By Dr. Melissa Schnyder Associate Professor of International Relations at American Public University Seeking Human Security In recent years, Europe’s refugee crisis has become an increasingly acute issue in need of a coordinated political response. Political instability to Europe’s south has prompted a surge in the number of asylum-seekers seeking refuge in the European Union. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 398,000 asylum applications were filed across the EU’s 28 member states in 2013, representing a 32 percent increase over the previous year. In its publication Asylum Trends, UNHCR estimated that in 2014 the world’s industrialized countries would witness the highest number of asylum applications in approximately 20 years. Seeking basic human security, migrants and refugees are fleeing areas experiencing extreme poverty, armed conflict, or political and social unrest. Migrants at Sea Facilitated by networks of human traffickers and smugglers, more and more migrants are embarking on dangerous journeys across the Mediterranean Sea in an effort to reach Europe. In 2013, three times as many migrants arrived in Italy by sea compared to 2012, and in January 2014, that figure was nearly 10 times what it had been the year prior. Both UNHCR and Frontex, the EU’s border management agency, report that the number of attempts to enter southern European countries surged in early 2014. Although many successfully reach Europe’s shores, the number of fatalities en route to Europe has risen dramatically. Although it is unknown exactly how many migrants have died attempting to cross the dangerous waters en route to Italy, Spain and other southern European destinations, in late 2013 at least 400 migrants drowned in shipwrecks as they attempted to reach Lampedusa, Italy’s southernmost island and its closest point to North Africa. Incidents like these have led the European Union to increase its sea patrols, signifying what many analysts have called a crisis in dire need of a coordinated response. Europe is not the only region experiencing this crisis. More recently, news wires reported thousands of Rohingya migrants fleeing Myanmar and Bangladesh to be “lost at sea” off Southeast Asia. In May, the International Organization for Migration believed as many as 8,000 Rohingya migrants to be stranded at sea. Since the Thai government began its crackdown on smugglers who are notorious for holding these migrants for ransom in camps in southern Thailand, smugglers are now reported to be abandoning the Rohingya at sea instead. States in the vicinity have generally not been willing to let them land and seek asylum, and the BBC reported that fisherman have also been instructed not to assist them. After weeks spent in rickety boats with very little food or water, in late May Indonesia and Malaysia agreed to take in thousands of migrants until they can either be resettled in another country or sent back home. However, the issue is far from resolved, as questions remain about where the Rohingya will ultimately be settled, and amid persecution and statelessness at home, more are expected to make the dangerous journey. A United Nations estimate put the number of migrants who fled Myanmar and Bangladesh by sea at about 25,000 during just the first three months of 2015. In Need of a Coordinated Response The sharp increase of migrants risking perilous journeys at sea attempting to flee conflict, instability, and persecution has left destination states in Europe and Southeast Asia scrambling to deal with this issue. From a human security perspective, many experts agree that, thus far, the response by states has been woefully inadequate. There is an immediate need to develop a consistent approach, centering on the development of shared guidelines among states in the region for rescue and disembarkation, as well as for determining and meeting protection needs for those seeking refuge. There is also a longer-term need for the international community to take meaningful steps to help stop the flow of refugees; experts have cited prosecuting the ringleaders of smuggling and trafficking operations, in conjunction with providing refugees legal avenues to stay and work on at least a temporary basis, as two recommendations. In the aftermath of more than 900 migrants having drowned off the coast of Libya in April en route to Europe, the EU is realizing more than ever the need for a coordinated response. Yet, as The New York Times reported, “governments are trying to balance humanitarian responsibilities against budget constraints and widespread public sentiment against immigration.” Many experts agree, however, that more effective measures need to be put in place. In a letter to the EU heads of state on preventing deaths at sea, Human Rights Watch argued that “what is required is a multinational operation with a clear mandate to actively seek out and rescue migrants and asylum seekers in distress at sea, and bring them to safe EU ports, where their claims can be processed in an orderly manner with all their rights respected and protected. The EU should also work quickly to set up safe and orderly methods for people to seek asylum in the EU without having to put their lives in the hands of unscrupulous smugglers.” In a post 9/11 world, states are more likely to view migration and asylum as security issues, and as a result may be less likely to consider the human security issues involved. This approach can prevent the concept of shared responsibility among states, which invokes a wider sense of responsibility and burden-sharing among the international community to help address the humanitarian crisis of migrants at sea, from being effectively put into practice.

The President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, is also on the island for commemorations. He found himself the focus of anger over how the crisis of migrants making dangerous crossings to Europe is being tackled. This as the Italian navy says it has rescued more than 2,000 migrants in the past few days; in one year more than 150,000 have been saved. The sinking of the migrant ship on October the 3rd last year pushed the issue right up the political agenda in Europe. It also forced Rome into a leading role in dealing with the crisis, with the government setting up its own migrant ship search and rescue programme, Mare Nostrum.More about: Ceremony Europe Illegal immigration Protest Victims More on the same theme Coastguards rescue 3,700 Mediterranean migrants in two days Amnesty International protest over migrant crisis in Europe Lost in France: the nightmare for migrants and local residents in… At least two dead after Pakistan anti-government protests turn violent Check out today's top stories 26/06 14:15 CET Tunisia: at least 27 dead in attack on hotel in Sousse 26/06 11:16 CET Decapitation and explosion in French Islamic terror attack 26/06 15:06 CET Kuwait: suicide attack kills many in mosque more... euronews LIVE euronews RADIO Latest Bulletin London, United Kingdom 79°F 26°C / 56°F 13°C More Weather… eurovibes Business Guide Most Viewed Most shared TodayYesterday7 Days 1Decapitation and explosion in French Islamic terror attack 2Pro-Kurdish party says Kobani ‘massacre’ reflects Turkish support for ISIL 3Tunisia: at least 27 dead in attack on hotel in Sousse 4“We want it to stop”, Lyon taxi drivers protest Uber 5EU leaders agree migrant plan, while Greek debt deal remains elusive1War, Russia, Poverty: Europeans’ ‘negative’ view of Ukraine 2Obama tells Hollande he is no longer spy target 3Eurozone Greek debt talks suspended till weekend 4Still no deal – talks to avoid a Greek debt default resume in Brussels 5Eurogroup meeting ends without Greece reforms agreement1No deal on Greek debt eurozone leaders schedule crisis summit for Monday 2War, Russia, Poverty: Europeans’ ‘negative’ view of Ukraine 37 things we found out at the Paris Air Show 2015 4London: WikiLeaks founder Assange marks three years in Ecuador’s embassy, as new cables released 5Three killed as Austrian ploughs car into crowd Facebook Twitter 1euronews live TV - News | euronews : the latest international news as video on demand2Spain’s first case of diphtheria in 30 years: parents of six-year-old ‘oppose vaccines’3[Live updates] NGO flotilla bids to break Israeli blockade of Gaza4Greek debt crisis is “absolute supremacy of capital over humans”5Large Hadron Collider ready to embark on an unprecedented voyage of discovery6Israel prepares to repel boarders as ‘Freedom Flotilla 3’ tries to run Gaza blockade7NewsWires : euronews : the latest international news as video on demand8Greek debt summit – Live updates9‘Distractingly sexy’ scientists hit back in lab chemistry polemic10Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria focus of EU cash fraud probes11Interpol issues ‘red notice’ for accused ex-FIFA bosses12Summit up in Brussels as Greek proposals give food for thought and rumours fly13Battle of Waterloo, live-tweeting 200 years on14Greek PM faces day of crucial bailout talks in Brussels15Latest News Bulletin16Citizens take power in Spain’s largest cities as a political revolution sweeps the country17Italy discovers biggest illegal waste dump in Europe18Hungary: billboard war sparks international concern19International news | euronews, latest international news20[Latest] AKP loses its majority as Kurdish party enter Turkish Parliament Wires > News 19:04 CET Kosovo lawmakers reject special court to try ex-guerrillas 18:40 CET Amid cries of blackmail, glimmers of Greek debt hope emerge 18:31 CET Big hurdles to Iran nuclear deal as deadline looms 18:16 CET U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark ruling legalizes gay marriage… 18:14 CET Romanian PM’s prolonged absence worries allies, foes scoff 18:11 CET Crews to attempt to recover nine victims of Alaska plane crash -… 17:54 CET Gun attack kills at least 28, including Europeans, at Tunisian… 17:47 CET Italy arrests suspected al Qaeda bomber at Rome airport euronews News European Affairs Business Special Reports Sport Culture no comment Sci-tech Travel Luxury Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ VK Tumblr Podcast YouTube DailyMotion NewsAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle EastBusinessSpecial ReportsSportCultureSci-techTravelLuxuryNews 24NewsWiresArchivesA - Z Site Indexeuronews LIVEeuronews RADIOLatest BulletinWeatherPicture of the dayno commentyouGet euronews onSmartphoneTabletComputerSmart TVSmartwatchGoogle GlassExtraseuronews apps : iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone 8, Windows 8, Nokia S40, Nokia Asha, Smart TV and Google Glasseurovibesfeedbackpodcastrssbusiness guidebrowse on mobileAll ProgrammesLatest programmesPostcardsEuropereal economythe global conversationon the frontlinegeneration ytargetbusiness planetno commentBusiness Lineperspectivestomorrow's cityeurope weeklylifei talku talkthe networkle magCinemahi-techinnovationsciencethe stationPress ConferenceAdvertisingDistributionPartnersEU CoveragecommunityJobsContact euronewsTerms & Conditionscookies Copyright © euronews 2015 </TEXT>

(CARL OSMOND/ASSOCIATED PRESS) Migrants reach safety aboard HMS Bulwark in the Mediterranean Sea between Italy and North Africa on May 13, 2015.(CARL OSMOND/ASSOCIATED PRESS) FRANÇOIS DUFOUR Fly the migrants to Europe Add to ... FRANÇOIS DUFOUR Contributed to The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday, Jun. 17, 2015 3:00AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Jun. 17, 2015 5:49AM EDT Comments AA François Dufour is editor of PlayBac Presse in FranceAn emergency situation requires an emergency solution. To stop the shipwrecks and the drownings in the Mediterranean, let’s put the presumed refugees (or “would-be refugees” as described in the British press) on planes directly to Europe.In the past year, about half the migrants crossing the Mediterranean were asylum seekers. The other half were economic migrants searching for jobs. That’s another story that I won’t address here. According to the UNHCR (the UN Refugee Agency), two migrants out of three in 2015 have been asylum seekers coming principally from five countries: Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia and Nigeria.Consequently, one migrant out of two on those death-boats has the right to go to Europe. More importantly, Europe has a duty to protect them.The 1951 Geneva convention protects any “person owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.”Europe also protects (this principle is called subsidiary or temporary protection) those who would face serious risks if they return to their home country.Here is the problem: If they have not received refugee or protected-person status, or at the very least an asylum visa, they cannot present themselves at airport check-in counters.This is despite the fact that a flight would be less expensive and infinitely less risky, as demonstrated by the very convincing video made by demographer Hans Rosling (available on YouTube at https://youtu.be/YO0IRsfrPQ4).The common sense solution is to grant them refugee or protected person status in situ.To do this, one must answer two questions: Who grants this status? Where could it be granted in situ?A first option: a UNHCR centre in Tripoli or elsewhere on the African coast with the power to grant refugee/protected person status, on behalf of European countries.A second option: a European union embassy with the same power in a few safe countries (that have flights to at least one European country): Algeria? Tunisia? Morocco? Sudan? Djibouti? Kenya? Lebanon? Countries that are safer than the ones the boat people are fleeing: Eritrea, Syria (for half of them, in 2015). But also: Somalia, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Iraq. And this must all be accomplished with great expediency as demanded by this emergency.Bear in mind that very few future refugees are requesting an asylum visa from, say, a French consulate in Africa, authorizing them to seek asylum or protection in France, especially as the French agency for refugees (l’OFPRA) can take three months to two years to resolve application requests.Both options (via the UNHCR or via a European embassy) then require the repartition of the total number of refugees among the 28 EU countries.Two main criteria could be used: population and wealth (GNP per inhabitant) and, of course, the foreign languages spoken by the refugees.Another advantage of this on-the-spot solution: It would reduce the large number of rejected asylum seekers in Europe who stay illegally (about three out of four) and live in poverty.For the past 10 years, I have interviewed African youths, both boys and girls, on the Italian island of Lampedusa.During their journey, they have been robbed, assaulted, exploited, some of them tortured, others raped. Without mentioning all those who have drowned.Why did they take such chances? Abdi (15) and Sihan (17) left total chaos in Somalia.Mohamed, an 18-year-old boy from Eritrea, refused to be chain-ganged for life into the dictator’s army. Just like Abel (16) and Rubel (17). Gift (18) from Nigeria, fled Boko Haram. Cynthia, a Nigerian 18-year-old orphan, was sold by her uncle.After hearing their stories, I always say to myself: In their shoes, I too would have fled toward the Mediterranean.   More Related to this Story Crépeau and Atak Mobility will stop the migrant tragedies, not the military Tragedy of the Muslim Rohingya echoes past injustices STEPHEN CORNISH Beyond rescuing migrants, we must recognize and share their humanity Topics: Europe Comments AA In the know Travel Attention, Canadians: Get that maple leaf off your backpack News California canines compete for World's Ugliest Dog title Life Here's a Toronto church conversion loft that drew rival bidders Life Sangria onesies, pineapple clutches: Fashion has gone loopy for fruit Most popular videos » News 'No, no, no.

Thirty-three people perished after the boat sank on Friday, a week after another shipwreck off Italy left at least 359 dead, prompting Malta to warn that the Mediterranean was becoming "a cemetery". The boat, carrying up to 400 migrants, mostly Syrians, left the Libyan port of Zwara on Thursday, just 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the Tunisian border. Survivors said Libyan militiamen shot wildly at their boat, leaving several people dead and causing the vessel to take on water and sink. Syrian national Mohammed, 34, broke down in tears as he recalled his desperate search for his missing pregnant wife and seven-year-old daughter after he and his five-year-old girl managed to reach safety. Mohammed told AFP he had paid a total of $4,800 (3,500 euros) for the trip to seek a better life in Europe, crossing through Egypt to Libya. "When we got on the boat, Libyan militia put their machine guns to our heads and demanded more money. I had $5,000 and they took this too," Mohammed said from a detention camp in Malta. He said the Libyan gunmen followed them for four or five hours. "All of a sudden, they started shooting at us and the boat. They injured two people with their bullets. All I could think of at that time was protect my two young children. "Then they started shooting more bullets at the boat and they managed to puncture it. Lots of water started coming in. It was filling quite fast until we all ended up in the sea. I grabbed my daughter. She swallowed water but I managed to swim and we got onto a raft rescuers threw in the water," Mohammed said. Citing testimonies from some of those who survived the crossing, the UN refugee agency spoke of several injured passengers, saying shots were fired "perhaps by militiamen who shot to kill". Molhake al-Roarsan, 22, interviewed by Italy's La Stampa newspaper, said three people were injured after being shot in the arms and legs. He said he thought the attacks were related to a dispute between different groups of traffickers. "There was a furious fight, screaming on the radio and on the phone with someone who demanded that we return to land, but the captain did not stop." News agency Ansa said witnesses spoke of two people being killed. "They were shooting in all directions, on board there was panic with people trying to protect each other," it quoted one survivor as saying. Once they reached Malta, the Tunisian captain was arrested after being recognised by survivors, according to media reports. Ashur, a Syrian, said he and his family were fleeing the civil war in his home country. When the vessel capsized he managed to save his two-year-old daughter but lost his son and wife who was pregnant with twins. "I lost practically all I had. What I have left to live for is my daughter who I will not let go out of my arms," Ashur told AFP. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat left Sunday for Libya to meet his counterpart Ali Zeidan, and discuss the surging migration levels and the latest disasters at sea. "We are just building a cemetery within our Mediterranean Sea," he said. The twin tragedies in the Mediterranean just days apart have prompted the European Union to call for sea patrols to cope with the flood of migrants knocking on its doors. Italy has appealed to fellow EU states for help in managing the refugee crisis and wants migration to be put on the agenda of summit talks in Brussels later this month. According to UNHCR estimates, some 32,000 migrants have arrived in Malta and Italy this year.   Recommended Advertisement Comments Your feedback is important to us!

Poland also participated in a limited way on the Allied side. The fight was over control of the Baltic and the lucrative trade in the Baltic Sea. The Danes also had a desire to restore the Kalmar Union with a Danish king. The war took place largely at sea. Fortunes of war changed, but the Swedes often had the upper hand until naval warfare went in to stand still for both sides during the final years of the war. The Swedish ships were largely dedicated warships with powerful armament, and  tried to avoid boarding tactics. The Danish and Lübeck ships were lighter built and equipped with a larger percentage of weak chamber loaded iron cannons. The Danish-Lübeck fleet fought in the traditional way and tried to reach a settlement through boarding. The allied fleet consisted of a higher proportion of armed and relatively weak trading vessels. Armament was increased on both sides during the war.  The Danes bought cast iron cannons from England, a novelty at the time. Sweden on the other hand had plentiful resources of cooper and armed their ships with superior cast bronze cannons. They could reach further and had more firepower. At the end of the war, which would qualify as a draw, Sweden had the largest navy in Europe. After the Nordic Seven Years War ships generally reduced in size. The large “floating infantry fort”  was over and when the ships start to grow larger again in the second half of the 1600s, it was with full focus on artillery. Some nations, including Sweden in the years around 1630, temporarily invested in a few relatively large ship, but that was the exception. Naval tactics According to Erik XIV's instructions in 1565 and 1566 the Swedish armada were to sail in groups of three.. A larger vessel second by two smaller ones. The Danish admiral Trolle issued similar directives, sailing in groups of three in a V formation, with the largest ship first. At a distance round balls where shot, but when the enemy approached they went on to include chain shots and incendiary grenades.  The Swedes tried to avoid being boarded, but instead kept their distance with superior artillery. Part of the Swedish fleet probably had a shortage of soldiers, which in addition to the superior artillery could explain the Swedish tactics of avoiding close contact. If the enemy tried to board, one would shoot off a storm of shrapnel with canister shots, but also throwing fire-balls and incendiary grenades. Long beams sticking out from the ship's side as well as saws to cut off enemy grappling hooks where used. The battle of Öland 1564 At the end of May 1564  the Swedish fleet set sail from Dalarö. It consisted of 37 vessels, including 16 major warships. On May the 30th, the Danish-Lübeck fleet of at least 25 warships and a number of smaller vessels where spotted some 20 nm north of Öland. The Swedes tried to keep a distance and decide the battle by taking advantage of their superior artillery. The Lübeck vessel Longe Barken was sunk by a barrage of artillery from Mars massive broadside. At dusk the battle died out. . After the first day of battle the Danish admiral Trolle and the Lübeck counterpart admiral Knebel agreed to board at all costs.  The Swedes accomplished so much damage with their artillery. Trolle's flagship Fortuna had been hit by 167 projectiles! The demise of the Mars When the night came the Swedish navy dispersed. At dawn only a few Swedish ships where in the Mars vicinity. In spite this the Swedish admiral Bagge attacked followed by the Elephant and Finnish Swan and tried to push the enemy towards the northern tip of Öland. When the wind turned, a number of Lübeckian ships used the opportunity to approach the Swedes. Several boarding attempts where repelled with Mars´s massive artillery. After an intensive melee Mars took fire, likely due to a cannon exploding, but possibly also of grenades that were thrown on board. Bagge fought bravely but finally surrendered and was transferred to an enemy ship with a hundred crew members. Meanwhile several hundred Lübeckian soldiers climbed the Mars to plunder the ship. Suddenly the gunpowder store exploded and up to a 1000 men, Swedes and Lübeckians, died. Jacob Bagge was imprisoned in Copenhagen and was released several years after the war.

<HEAD> List of ships sunk by submarines by death toll - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </HEAD>
<TEXT> List of ships sunk by submarines by death toll From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from List by death toll of ships sunk by submarines) Jump to: navigation, search Heavy casualties occurred when large passenger ships such as the Wilhelm Gustloff were overloaded with soldiers, prisoners, or refugees. Self-propelled torpedoes dramatically increased effectiveness of submarine warships. Initial scouting patrols against surface warships sank several cruisers in the first month of World War I. Incidental encounters with merchant ships were handled by signalling the ship to stop and sinking the ship after removing the crew in accordance with international law. After unrestricted submarine warfare began in February 1915, any ship might unexpectedly sink rapidly from heavy underwater hull damage inflicted by torpedoes. Many large ships sank unknown to friendly forces, and the submarines which sank them were too small to rescue more than a few survivors.[1] Heavy personnel casualties continued through World War II, and there have been a few later sinkings. This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.

Body bags lie in the harbour of Lampedusa following the accident Photo: REUTERS By By Our Foreign Staff 3:17PM BST 03 Oct 2013 Comments Emergency workers were battling to locate some 200 African migrants still missing in Italian waters after their boat caught fire and sank off the Sicilian island. On Thursday afternoon, Italian rescue divers found 40 bodies under and inside the wreck, AFP reported, which would bring the toll in the disaster to 133 dead. Angelino Alfano, the deputy prime minister, said the incident illustrated that European assistance was needed to deal with the continuing influx of refugees, saying it was "a European tragedy, not just an Italian one". "The toll is unfortunately a tragic one, he told a press conference in Rome. Only three of an estimated 100 women aboard the boat have been rescued, while no children had so far been saved, the International Organisation for Migration in Rome said. "Only the strongest survived," Simona Moscarelli, a legal expert for the group, told the Associated Press. Most of the migrants - all of whom are believed to have come from Eritrea - could not swim, she added.

So far 159 people have been rescued, but the boat is believed to have been carrying as many as 500 people. One migrant pulled from the sea said they had come from the Libyan port of Misrata. Shaken survivors wrapped in thermal blankets - many of them bare-chested - were seen arriving on the dock in images shown on Italian television, as an emergency worker broke down in tears. "We left two days ago from the Libyan port of Misurata. We were 500 on that boat, we could hardly move," one survivor said, ANSA reported. "Three fishing boats spotted us during the crossing but did not rescue us." The bodies of those who drowned have been taken to a hangar at the local airport because there is no more room in the local morgue on the remote southern Italian island, which has a population of around 6,000. "This is a tragedy without precedent. In many years of work here I have never seen anything like this," Pietro Bartolo, a local doctor, was quoted by the Italian news agency ANSA as saying. "We don't need ambulances unfortunately, we need hearses. There are still hundreds missing." Survivors are brought ashore wrapped in thermal blankets. (REUTERS) It is one of the deadliest migrant shipwrecks in recent times and the second one this week off Italy: On Monday, 13 men drowned while trying to reach southern Sicily when their ship ran aground just a few yards from shore at Scicli. Pope Francis, who visited Lampedusa in July to plead for more tolerance and attention to the plight of refugees, called for prayers. "This is shameful," the pope said at a Vatican conference. "Let us join forces so these tragedies never happen again." Giusi Nicolini, the Mayor of Lampedusa, said the boat sinking was "an immense tragedy". She said that survivors from the tragedy had told her they lit a small fire on the boat around half a mile from the shore to attract the attention of coast guards after it suffered engine failure. The fire then spread, sowing panic on board which caused the boat to flip over and eventually sink. "The survivors are in a state of shock," she said. "They have been in the water since the early hours of the morning." Coast Guard ships and helicopters from across the region, as well as local fishing boats, were on the scene trying to find survivors in the sea. "We have 92 dead and 151 people saved. We are looking for more survivors in the water," a coast guard spokesman told AFP, adding that the search had been going on for more than six hours.

On Thursday, a boat carrying 500 migrants sank just half a mile from the Sicilian coast. Publish Date October 3, 2013. Photo by Agence France-Presse -- Getty Images.

But it was still dark and no one had yet spotted them. So to signal their position, someone set a match to a blanket.But rather than sending a signal, the fire brought tragedy when flames from the burning blanket ignited gasoline. Nearly 500 people are estimated to have been on board — including children — and the blaze created a panic that capsized the boat. So close to reaching land, the migrants were now tossed into the sea. Many could not swim. The accident, which occurred before dawn on Thursday within easy eyesight of the island of Lampedusa, is one of the worst in recent memory in the Mediterranean: at least 111 people were reported dead, with up to 250 still missing. At least 150 others survived, and Italy’s Coast Guard was continuing to search for more survivors. Photo About 500 people were said to be on a boat bound for Italy. Credit The New York Times The grisly deaths again underscored the dangerous, desperate efforts by many migrants from Africa and the Middle East to reach Europe by sea, while also renewing criticism of European immigration policy. Immigration is a politically volatile issue in Europe, so much so that Greece recently completed a nearly eight-mile fence blocking its border with Turkey, an attempt to shut down a major land migration route.But some experts say that making it harder to slip into Europe by land has only pushed many migrants to try the more perilous route by sea. With conflicts raging in the Middle East and Africa, the number of asylum seekers and migrants arriving by boat in Spain and Italy has spiked this year. According to statistics released by Save the Children, 21,780 migrants reached Italy during the first nine months of this year, including 4,000 children.Lampedusa, an Italian island barely 70 miles from northern Africa, has become a gateway to Europe for migrants. In some seasons, boats filled with migrants and asylum seekers arrive almost daily. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Pope Francis, who visited the island in July to draw attention to the plight of migrants, expressed sadness and outrage over Thursday’s fatal accident.“The word disgrace comes to me,” the pope said during an audience, calling for prayers on behalf of the dead and their families. “Let us unite our efforts so that similar tragedies do not happen again. Only a decided collaboration among all can help to stop them.”For Italy, the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean has become an enormous operational and humanitarian challenge. Italian Coast Guard boats are sent almost daily on dangerous rescue missions. Migrants assume huge risks to reach Europe and pay thousands of dollars to smugglers and middlemen, often in Turkey, Egypt and Libya. The smugglers load people onto a large boat for a trip into Italian waters. There, the migrants are usually transferred to smaller boats, some barely seaworthy, and left to float in the current. Then the smugglers flee back to Africa.

It did seem clear, though, that they were completely unprepared. Photo The bodies of those killed when a boat packed with migrants caught fire then capsized as it approached Italy’s Lampedusa Island. Credit Antonio Parrinello/Reuters “Normally, these boats have a satellite phone, or someone on board will call a relative in Italy who alerts the authorities,” said Veronica Lentini, who works with the International Organization for Migration in Lampedusa, and spoke with several survivors. “But in this case, no one advised anyone.”Survivors told Ms. Lentini that their ship had traveled from Libya and was a short distance from a tiny sister island of Lampedusa when the engine broke down. Soon, the ship began to take on water, and the fire was started to attract attention. But gas from the broken engine was ignited by the flames, and terrified passengers raced away from the explosion, to one side of the vessel, causing it to capsize. Lillian Pizzi, a psychologist working with migrant families on Lampedusa, said the survivors were in a state of shock.“They’re exhausted and they’re finding it difficult to explain exactly what happened,” said Ms. Pizzi, who works for Terre des Hommes, a nonprofit group. She added: “It is something that happens all too often. It has to be read politically. This is not an accident at sea. It is something else.”In Rome, Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said that the vessel had departed from Misurata in Libya, and that most of the passengers were from Eritrea and Somalia. No one onboard had a mobile phone, and he confirmed that gasoline was to blame for the rapid spread of the fire.“It happened close to shore,” Mr. Alfano said. “Had they been able to swim, they would have been safe.” Mr. Alfano said Italian rescue boats had been sent as soon as the fire was spotted, and he called on European officials to find solutions to prevent such disasters. “Europe must realize it is not an Italian drama but a European one,” he said during a news conference. “Lampedusa must become the border of Europe, not Italy.” Photo First responders brought the bodies of drowned migrants to shore from a Coast Guard boat on Thursday in Lampedusa, Italy. Credit Italian Army, via European Pressphoto Agency The death toll was high on Thursday, and could potentially go much higher, but such fatal accidents are hardly rare in the Mediterranean. According to the International Organization for Migration, roughly 25,000 people have died in the Mediterranean in the last 20 years, including 1,700 last year. This week, 13 men drowned near the shore of southern Sicily.Bruce Leimsidor, an expert in European asylum law, said that many complex factors contributed to such deaths, and that the new wall in Greece was probably contributing to the increased activity on the Mediterranean.Europe’s complicated asylum regulations vary for African countries, yet even red tape does not deter migrants from taking risks to escape.“It’s like trying to hold a balloon under water,” said Professor Leimsidor, who teaches at Ca’ Foscari University in Venice. “The only thing Europe can do is basically take people and give them decent asylum procedures.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story On Thursday, European Commission officials expressed sadness about the accident and blamed criminal syndicates and human smugglers for exploiting desperate people. They called for a crackdown on the smugglers while saying that Europe also needs to step up dialogue with the countries from which migrants originate. “No country can solve migratory flows by itself,” said Michele Cercone, a spokesman for Europe’s home affairs commissioner. “This won’t end overnight. We have to put in place new tools, new policies to manage better, and we have to do it at a European level.”But finding a unified immigration policy is difficult, given that member states have different attitudes and policies toward immigrants. And many advocates for migrants said the European Union had done too little to open legal channels for people to migrate, especially those who are not wealthy or educated, and also needed to improve resettlement programs for refugees and asylum seekers.“Even people who aren’t engineers have reasons to want to have a good life, and come to Europe, a place of safety and opportunity,” said Philip Amaral, advocacy and communications coordinator for the Brussels-based Jesuit Refugee Service Europe. For many, he said, “the only option is to take a risky trip.” Correction: October 3, 2013 A picture with an earlier version of this article was published in error.

Rescue crews reported seeing bodies in the water but the coast guard said most of the passengers had been rescued. Helicopters ferried the injured to Lampedusa, while a half-dozen Italian and Maltese ships responded at the scene. The capsizing occurred some 105 kilometers southeast of Lampedusa, but in waters where Malta has search and rescue responsibilities. The coast guard received a satellite phone call from the boat that was in distress on Friday and was able to locate it based on the satellite coordinates, said coast guard spokesman Marco Di Milla. A Maltese aircraft was sent up and reported that the boat had capsized and that “numerous” people were in the water. The aircraft dropped a life raft, and a patrol boat soon arrived at the scene, according to a statement from the Maltese armed forces. Di Milla said “a good number” of the estimated 200 people had been rescued, and Maltese police said an unspecified number would be taken to Malta. But rescue crews also reported seeing corpses in the water, a Maltese government spokesman said. Related‘Most of them can’t swim’: Hundreds dead, many women and children, after migrant ship capsizes off of Italy The capsizing occurred a week after a migrant ship from Libya capsized and sank with some 500 people on board near and island off Lampedusa’s coast. Only 155 survived. Recovery efforts continued Friday, bringing the toll up to 339, including a newborn with its umbilical cord still attached, Di Milla said. The deaths from the Oct. 3 wreck prompted calls for the European Union to do more to better patrol the southern Mediterranean and prevent such tragedies. Lampedusa, a tiny speck of an island closer to Africa than the Italian mainland, is the destination of choice of smugglers ferrying migrants from Libya or Tunisia to Europe. They usually charge more than 1,000 euro ($1,355) a head and cram the migrants onto boats that routinely run into trouble and require rescue. Once in Italy, the migrants are screened for asylum and often sent back home if they don’t qualify. During the 1990s and early 2000s, many of the arrivals were considered “economic migrants.” But many of the latest arrivals are fleeing persecution and conflict in places such as Syria and Egypt, and qualify for refugee status, U.N. officials say. Many eventually end up in northern Europe’s larger and more organized immigrant communities Many eventually end up in northern Europe’s larger and more organized immigrant communities. During a visit to Lampedusa this week, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso promised Italy some 30 million euro in EU funds to better care for newly arrived migrants, and Italian officials pledged to put the issue on the agenda of an upcoming European Union summit and on the EU agenda next year, when Italy and Greece hold the EU presidencies. Some 30,100 migrants arrived in Italy and Malta in the first nine months of 2013, compared with 15,000 in all of 2012, according to the U.N. refugee agency.

<HEAD> Shipwreck - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </HEAD>
<TEXT> Shipwreck From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search For the event of a ship wrecking, see Shipwrecking. For other uses, see Shipwreck (disambiguation). Shipwreck of the SS American Star on the shore of Fuerteventura Johan Christian Dahl: Shipwreck on the Coast of Norway, 1832 A shipwreck is the remains of a ship that has wrecked, which are found either beached on land or sunken to the bottom of a body of water. Shipwrecking may be deliberate or accidental. UNESCO estimates that worldwide over 3 million shipwrecks, some thousands of years old, lie on seabeds.[1][2] Contents 1 Types 2 Causes 3 State of preservation 3.1 Construction materials 3.2 Salinity of water 3.3 Loss, salvage and demolition 3.4 Depth, tide and weather 3.5 Temperature 4 Salvage 4.1 Legal aspects 4.2 Notable salvages 5 See also 6 References 7 Further reading 8 External links Types[edit] The 1626 Sparrow-Hawk wreck is displayed at the Pilgrim Hall Museum in Plymouth, Massachusetts Historic wrecks are attractive to maritime archaeologists because they preserve historical information: for example, studying the wreck of Mary Rose revealed information about seafaring, warfare, and life in the 16th century. Military wrecks, caused by a skirmish at sea, are studied to find details about the historic event; they reveal much about the battle that occurred. Discoveries of treasure ships, often from the period of European colonisation, which sank in remote locations leaving few living witnesses, such as the Batavia, do occur but only very infrequently.[citation needed] Some contemporary wrecks, such as the oil tankers Prestige or Erika, are of interest primarily because of their potential harm to the environment. Other contemporary wrecks are scuttled in order to spur reef growth, such as Adolphus Busch and the Ocean Freeze. Wrecks like Adolphus Busch and historic wrecks such as SS Thistlegorm are of interest to recreational divers that dive to shipwrecks because they are interesting to explore, provide large habitats for many types of marine life, and have an interesting history.[citation needed] Very few shipwrecks are as famous as the catastrophic Titanic, Britannic, Lusitania, Estonia, Empress of Ireland, Andrea Doria, or Costa Concordia. There are also thousands of wrecks that were not lost at sea but have been abandoned or sunk. These abandoned, or derelict ships are typically smaller craft, such as fishing vessels. They may pose a hazard to navigation[3] and may be removed by port authorities.[4] There are more than 3 million wrecks on the ocean floor, the United Nations estimates.[2] Causes[edit] Main article: Shipwrecking County of Peebles, used as breakwater in Punta Arenas at the Strait of Magellan Poor design, improperly stowed cargo, navigation and other human errors leading to collisions (with another ship, the shoreline, an iceberg, etc.), bad weather, fire, and other causes can lead to accidental sinkings. Intentional reasons for sinking a ship include forming an artificial reef; due to warfare, piracy, mutiny or sabotage; as part of target practice; or to remove a menace to navigation. Also a ship can be used as breakwater structure. State of preservation[edit] The Vasa is one of the oldest and best-preserved ships salvaged in the world, owing to the cool temperatures and low salinity of the Baltic Sea Many factors determine the state of preservation of a wreck: the ship's construction materials the wreck becoming covered in sand or silt the salinity of the water the wreck is in the level of destruction involved in the ship's loss whether the components or cargo of the wreck were salvaged whether the wreck was demolished to clear a navigable channel the depth of water at the wreck site the strength of tidal currents or wave action at the wreck site the exposure to surface weather conditions at the wreck site the presence of marine animals that consume the ship's fabric temperature the acidity (or pH), and other chemical characteristics of the water at the site The above-mentioned, especially the stratification (silt/sand sediments piled up on the shipwrecks) and the damages caused by marine creatures is better described as "stratification and contamination" of shipwrecks. The stratification not only creates another challenge for marine archaeology but also a challenge to its primary state, the state that it had when it sank. Stratification includes several different types of sand and/or silt, as well as tumulus and encrustations. These "sediments" are tightly linked to the type of currents, depth, and the type of water (salinity, pH, etc.), which implies any chemical reactions that would lead to affecting the hypothetical/possible main cargo (such as wine, olive oil, spices, etc.). Besides this geological phenomenon, wrecks also face the damage of marine creatures that create a home out of them; primarily being octopuses and crustaceans. These creatures affect the primary state because they move, or break, any parts of the shipwreck that are in their way, thereby affecting the original condition of amphorae, for example, or any other hollow places. Finally, in addition to the slight or severe destruction marine animals can create, there are also "external" contaminants, such as modern-day commodities, or contemporary pollution in bodies of water, that as well severely affect shipwrecks by changing the chemical structures, or even destroying or devastating even more of what is left of a specific ship. All the above offers great challenges to the marine archaeologist when attempting to bind the pieces of a certain shipwreck together. Despite these challenges, if the information retrieved does not appear to be sufficient, or a poor preservation is achieved, authors like J.A. Parker claim that it is the historical value of the shipwreck that counts, as well as any slight piece of information and/or evidence that is acquired.[5] Construction materials[edit] The Wreck, by Knud-Andreassen Baade c.1835 Exposed wooden components decay quickly. Often the only wooden parts of ships that remain after a century are those that were buried in silt or sand soon after the sinking. An example of this is the Mary Rose. Steel and iron, depending on their thickness, may retain the ship's structure for decades. As corrosion takes place, sometimes helped by tides and weather, the structure collapses. Thick ferrous objects such as cannons, steam boilers or the pressure vessel of a submarine often survive well underwater in spite of corrosion. Propellers, condensers, hinges and port holes were often made from non-ferrous metals such as brass and phosphor bronze, which do not corrode easily. Salinity of water[edit] Freshwater and low saline Shipwrecks in some freshwater lakes, such as the Great Lakes of North America, have remained intact with little degradation. In some sea areas, most notably in Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland, salinity is very low, and centuries-old wrecks have been preserved in reasonable condition.[citation needed] However, bacteria found in fresh water cause the wood on ships to rot more quickly than in seawater unless it's deprived of oxygen.[citation needed] Seawater Wrecks typically decay rapidly when in seawater. There are several reasons for this: Iron-based metals corrode much more quickly in seawater because of the dissolved salt present; the sodium and chloride ions chemically accelerate the process of metal oxidation which, in the case of ferrous metals, leads to rust. Such cases are prominent on deep-water shipwrecks, such as the RMS Titanic (which sank in 1912), RMS Lusitania (which sank in 1915), and the Bismarck (which sank in 1941).[citation needed] However, there are some exceptions, the RMS Empress of Ireland lies in the saltwater portion of the St. Lawrence River, but is still in remarkably good conditions.[6] Unprotected wood in seawater is rapidly consumed by shipworms and small wood-boring sea creatures.[citation needed] Shipworms found in higher salinity waters, such as the Caribbean, are notorious for boring into wooden structures that are immersed in sea water and can completely destroy the hull of a wooden shipwreck.[7] Loss, salvage and demolition[edit] This section does not cite any references or sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2013) The shipwreck of SS Austria on 13 September 1858 An important factor in the condition of the wreck is the level of destruction at the time of the loss or shortly afterwards due to the nature of the loss, salvage or later demolition. Examples of severe destruction at the time of loss are: Being blown onto a beach, reef, or rocks during a storm, termed "grounding" (e.g., Royal Adelaide) Collision with another ship (e.g., SS Andrea Doria) Catastrophic explosion (e.g., HMS Hood), steamship boilers often explode when water covers them during the process of sinking Fire that burns for a long time before the ship sinks (e.g., MS Achille Lauro) Foundering, i.e., taking in so much water that buoyancy is lost and the ship sinks (e.g., the RMS Titanic and the HMHS Britannic); some ships with a dense cargo (e.g., iron ore) may break up when sinking quickly and hitting a rocky seabed Enemy action from aerial bombs or submarine torpedoes that may cause destruction before sinking (e.g., the RN Roma and the HMS Barham) After the loss the vessel's owners may attempt to salvage valuable parts of the ship and/or its cargo; this operation can cause further damage. Shipwrecks in shallow water near busy shipping lanes are often demolished or removed to reduce the danger to other vessels. On charts, some wreck symbols have a line under the symbol with a depth mark, which indicates the water depth above the wreck. Depth, tide and weather[edit] On the seabed, wrecks are slowly broken up by the forces of wave action caused by the weather and currents caused by tides. Also more highly oxygenated water, which promotes corrosion, reduces the strength of ferrous structural materials of the ship. Deeper wrecks are likely to be protected by less exposure to water movement and by lower levels of oxygen in water. Temperature[edit] Extreme cold (such as in a glacial-fed lake) can lead to slow degradation of organic ship materials[vague]. Salvage[edit] Wreckage of the RMS Titanic, perhaps the most famous of all shipwrecks Often, attempts are made to salvage recently wrecked ships to recover the whole or part of the ship, its cargo, or its equipment. A good example of this was the scuttling and subsequent salvage of the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow in the 1920s. The unauthorized salvage of wrecks is called wrecking. Legal aspects[edit] Shipwreck law determines important legal questions regarding wrecks, perhaps the most important question being the question of ownership. Legally wrecks are divided into wreccum maris (material washed ashore after a shipwreck) and adventurae maris (material still at sea);[8] although some legal systems treat the two categories differently, others treat them the same. Wrecks are often considered separately from their cargo. For example, in the English case of the Lusitania [1986] QB 384 it was accepted that the remains of the vessel itself were owned by the insurance underwriters who had paid out on the vessel as a total loss by virtue of the law of subrogation (who subsequently sold their rights), but that the property aboard the wreck still belonged to its original owners (or their descendants). Military wrecks, however, remain under the jurisdiction–and hence protection–of the government that lost the ship, or that government's successor. Hence, a German U-boat from World War II still technically belongs to the German government, even though the Third Reich is long-defunct. Many military wrecks are also protected by virtue of their being war graves. However, many legal systems allow the rights of salvors to override the rights of the original owners of a wreck or its cargo. As a general rule, non-historic civilian shipwrecks are considered fair game for salvage. Under international maritime law, for shipwrecks of a certain age, the original owner may have lost all claim to the cargo. Anyone who finds the wreck can then file a salvage claim on it and place a lien on the vessel, and subsequently mount a salvage operation (see Finders, keepers).[citation needed] Some countries assert claims to all wrecks within their territorial waters, irrespective of the interest of the original owner or the salvor.[9] Wartime wrecks have different legal considerations, as they are often considered prizes of war, and therefore owned by the Navy that sank them. MSC Napoli beached off Branscombe Some legal systems regard a wreck (and/or its cargo) to be abandoned if no attempt is made to salvage them within a certain period of time. English law has usually resisted this notion (encouraged by an extremely large maritime insurance industry, which asserts claims in respect of shipwrecks which it has paid claims on), but it has been accepted to a greater or lesser degree in an Australian case[10] and in a Norwegian case.[11] The American courts have been inconsistent between states and at Federal level.[12] Under Danish law, all shipwrecks over 150 years old belong to the state if no owner can be found. In Spain, wrecks vest in the state if not salvaged within 3 years. In Finland, all property on board shipwrecks over 100 years old vests in the state. The British Protection of Wrecks Act, enacted to protect historic wrecks, controls access to wrecks such as Cattewater Wreck which can only be visited or investigated under licence. The British Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 also restricts access to wrecks which are sensitive as war graves. The Protection of Military Remains Act in some cases creates a blanket ban on all diving; for other wrecks divers may visit provided they do not touch, interfere with or penetrate the wreck. In the United States, shipwrecks in state waters are regulated by the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act of 1987. This act is much more lenient in allowing more open access to the shipwrecks. Following the beaching of the MSC Napoli, as a result of severe damage incurred during European storm Kyrill, there was confusion in the press and by the authorities about whether people could be prevented from helping themselves to the flotsam which was washed up on the beaches at Branscombe. Many people took advantage of the confusion and helped themselves to the cargo. This included many BMW motorbikes and empty wine casks as well as bags of disposable nappies (diapers).[13] The legal position under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 is that any such finds and recovery must be reported within 28 days to the Receiver of Wreck.[14] Failure to do so is an offence under the Merchant Shipping Act and can result in a criminal record for theft by finding.[15] After several days, the police and Receiver of Wreck, in conjunction with the landowner and the contracted salvors, established a cordon to prevent access to the beach.[16] A similar situation occurred after the wreck of the MV Cita in 1997. Historic wrecks (often but not always defined as being more than 50 years of age) are often protected from pillaging and looting through national laws protecting cultural heritage.[17] Internationally they may be protected by a State ratifying the Unesco Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. In this case pillaging is not allowed. One such example is the Queen Anne's Revenge[18] which is undergoing archaeological recovery by the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources near Beaufort Inlet, NC. The infamous pirate Blackbeard's flagship[19] was discovered by Intersal, Inc., a private research firm, in 1996.[20] An important international convention aiming at the protection of underwater cultural heritage (including shipwrecks) is the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage.[21] The 2001 UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage represents the international community's response to the increasing looting and destruction of underwater cultural heritage. It forms part of a group of UNESCO standard setting instruments regarding the domain of cultural heritage, encompassing seven conventions adopted by UNESCO Member States, which constitute a coherent and complementary body guaranteeing a complete protection of all forms of cultural heritage. The UNESCO 2001 Convention is an international treaty aimed exclusively at the protection of underwater cultural heritage and the facilitation of international cooperation in this regard. It does not change sovereignty rights of States or regulate the ownership of wrecks or submerged ruins. Notable salvages[edit] In 2011, the most valuable cargo of a sunken shipwreck was identified near the western edge of the Celtic Sea. This World War II era sinking of the SS Gairsoppa led to a treasure almost three miles deep.[22] See also[edit] Shipwreck on a shore near Gytheio, Greece.

<TEXT> List of maritime disasters From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search The List of maritime disasters is a link page for maritime disasters by century. Contents 1 Maritime Disasters prior to the 18th century 1.1 Peacetime disasters 1.2 Wartime disasters 2 18th century 3 19th century 4 20th century 4.1 World War I 4.2 World War II 5 21st century 6 See also 7 References Maritime Disasters prior to the 18th century[edit] Peacetime disasters[edit] Many maritime disasters happen outside the realms of war. All ships, including those of the military, are vulnerable to problems from weather conditions, faulty design or human error. Some of the disasters below occurred in periods of conflict, although their losses were unrelated to any military action. The table listings are in descending order of the magnitude of casualties suffered. Year Country Description Deaths Image 1694 England HMS Sussex – the third-rate was lost in a fierce storm on 1 March 1694 off Gibraltar. There were two survivors from a crew of 500. 498 1120  England White Ship – Ship carrying the heir to the English Throne and the Duchy of Normandy, and over 300 others. Drunk crew ran her aground in the English Channel. There were two survivors, and the loss caused 20 years of civil war over the English crown. 300 1647 Netherlands Princess Amelia – On 27 September 1647, Captain Bol mistook the Bristol Channel for the English Channel and ran her aground off the Mumbles, Wales where she broke apart. Of 107 passengers aboard, 21 survived. 86 Wartime disasters[edit] Disasters with high losses of life can occur in times of armed conflict. Shown below are some of the known events with major losses. Year Country Description Lives lost Image 1274 1281 Mongol Empire Kamikaze - The Mongol fleet destroyed in a typhoon. 100,000+ -253 !256 BCE 253 BCE Roman Republic First Punic War – In the First Punic War, between the Roman Republic and Carthage, a Roman fleet that had just rescued a Roman army from Africa was caught in a Mediterranean storm. Rome may have lost more than 90,000 men. 90,000+ 1588  Spain Spanish Armada – On 8 August 1588, Philip II of Spain sent the Armada to invade England. Spain lost 15,000–20,000 soldiers and sailors, mainly in storms rather than battle.[1] 15,000-20,000 1589  England English Armada – Also known as the Counter Armada or the Drake-Norris Expedition, was a fleet of warships sent to the Iberian Coast by Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1589, during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) and the Eighty Years' War. It was led by Sir Francis Drake as admiral and Sir John Norreys as general, and failed to drive home the advantage England had won upon the dispersal of the Spanish Armada in the previous year. The campaign resulted in the defeat of the English fleet and eventually to a withdrawal with heavy losses both in lives and ships. 11,000-15,000 1588  Spain Girona – On 28 October 1588, as part of the Spanish Armada, the Spanish galleass Girona was sunk in a gale off Ireland. Of the estimated 1,300 people aboard, nine survived; 260 bodies were washed ashore. 1,300 1564  Sweden Mars – A Swedish warship that was sunk 18 kilometres north of Öland during the Northern Seven Years' War. The crown ship of King Eric XIV of Sweden's fleet. The gunpowder store exploded and up to 1,000 men, including Swedes and the invading Lübeckians, died.[2] 900-1100 1692  France Soleil-Royal – On 3 June 1692, in the Battle of La Hougue, the French flagship was attacked by 17 ships at Pointe du Hommet. She managed to repel them with artillery fire, but a fire ship set her stern afire and it soon reached her powder rooms. The people of Cherbourg came to the rescue, but there was only one survivor from 883–950 crew. 882-949 1676  Sweden Kronan – In the Battle of Öland in 1676, the warship capsized while turning. Gunpowder aboard ignited and exploded. Of the estimated 800 aboard, 42 survived. 758 1545  England Mary Rose – The warship sank in the Battle of the Solent on 19 July 1545. The cause is unknown, but believed to have been due to water entering her open gunports and capsizing her. About 500 people were lost. 480-520 1591  England HMS Revenge – After being captured in battle, the English galleon was lost in a storm near the Azores in 1591. An estimated 200 Spanish sailors who captured her were lost. 200 1678  France Las Aves disaster – on 11 May 1678 a French fleet under Adm. Jean II d'Estrées was wrecked on the Las Aves archipelago due to an error in navigation. Nine of the fleets 30 ships were lost. Estimates of the lives lost vary wildly, from 24 to over 1,500. 24 - 1,500 18th century[edit] See List of maritime disasters in the 18th century 19th century[edit] See List of maritime disasters in the 19th century 20th century[edit] See List of maritime disasters in the 20th century World War I[edit] See List of maritime disasters in World War I World War II[edit] See List of maritime disasters in World War II 21st century[edit] See List of maritime disasters in the 21st century See also[edit] Shipwreck List of shipwrecks List of disasters List of accidents and disasters by death toll List by death toll of ships sunk by submarines List of RORO vessel accidents References[edit] ^ "Queen Elizabeth I – Against the Spanish Armada".

Notes[सम्पादन गर्ने] ↑ १.० १.१ १.२ Google Maps has introduced a reverse-geocoding feature, which gives priority to the closest object in their database, instead of the desired coordinates. The closest object is shown with a bright red marker with the map centered on it, and the requested coordinates are given a green marker that often blends into the background or is outside the displayed area. It might be called the "you must have meant this" feature. Our use of the Google Maps KML generator for Google Earth links is also affected. That's not something that can be fixed here. read more...

<HEAD> List of shipwrecks in the Great Lakes - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </HEAD>
<TEXT> List of shipwrecks in the Great Lakes From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search The Great Lakes, a collection of five freshwater lakes located in North America, have been sailed upon since at least the 17th century, and thousands of ships have been sunk while traversing them. Many of these ships were never found, so the exact number of shipwrecks in the Lakes is unknown; the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum approximates 6,000 ships and 30,000 lives lost,[1] while historian and mariner Mark Thompson has estimated that the total number of wrecks is likely more than 25,000.[2] In the period between 1816, when the Invincible was lost, to the sinking of the Fitzgerald in 1975, the Whitefish Point area alone has claimed at least 240 ships.[2] Map of the shipwrecks in the Great Storm of 1913 This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.

Karl-Friedrich Merten After a ten-year stint on warships and serving on the WWI battleship Schleswig-Holstein during the attack on Westerplatte which started the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Merten joined the U-boat arm on 1 May 1940. He operated all over the world, patrolling in the Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean. U-68 was in wolfpack Eisbär (Polar bear), which in the course of a few weeks during September/October 1942 sank more than 100,000 tons of shipping off South Africa. In January 1943 Merten became the commander of the 26th U-boat Flotilla at Pillau. There the new U-boat crews received their final training before going to the front. In March 1943 Merten transferred to command the 24th Flotilla at Memel. This was the training flotilla for future U-boat commanders. After the war Merten salvaged sunken ships in the Rhine with another famous former U-boat commander, Heinrich Lehmann-Willenbrock. He later worked in the shipbuilding industry.

Kingdon, RN) and the Polish destroyer Grom (Lt.Cdr. A. Hulewicz, ORP) were ordered to leave Harwich and establish a patrol in the North Sea. Shortly before that, a German He 59 seaplane dropped two magnetic mines nearby, but there was no time for searching. HMS Gipsy hit one of those mines which tore her into two pieces. Most of the survivors were picked up by HMS Griffin and HMS Keith. (1) Media links British destroyers & frigatesNorman Friedman Destroyers of World War TwoWhitley, M. J.

Notable events involving Boadicea include: HMS Boadicea now lies at 50m upright on the seabed, her bows blown off, but her stern and aft mid section intact. Depth charges and torpedo tubes are clearly visible, as is her aft gun although the armour plating has gone. (1) 21 Nov 1939Around 2100 hours the British destroyers HMS Griffin (Lt.Cdr. J. Lee-Barber, RN with Capt. G.E. Creasy, MVO, RN aboard), HMS Gipsy (Lt.Cdr. N.J. Crossley, RN), HMS Keith (Cdr. H.T.W. Pawsey, OBE, RN), HMS Boadicea (Lt.Cdr. G.B. Kingdon, RN) and the Polish destroyer Grom (Lt.Cdr. A. Hulewicz, ORP) were ordered to leave Harwich and establish a patrol in the North Sea. Shortly before that, a German He 59 seaplane dropped two magnetic mines nearby, but there was no time for searching. HMS Gipsy hit one of those mines which tore her into two pieces. Most of the survivors were picked up by HMS Griffin and HMS Keith. 6 Feb 1940HMS Boadicea (Lt.Cdr. G.B. Kingdon, RN) and HMS Beagle (Lt.Cdr. R.H. Wright, RN) sail from Boulogne with the Prime Minister, War cabinet and Chief of Staff for Dover. 11 Nov 1942The British troop transport Viceroy of India was torpedoed and damaged by German U-boat U-407 34 nautical miles north-west of Oran, Algeria in position 36°26'N, 00°24'W. She was taken in tow by HMS Boadicea (Lt.Cdr. F.C. Brodrick, RN) but sank in position 36°24'N, 00°35'W. Boadicea picked up 450 survivors. 18 Jul 1943At 07.56 hours on 18 July 1943, the unescorted British passenger ship Incomati was torpedoed and damaged by German U-boat U-508 about 200 nautical miles south of Lagos. At 08.18 hours, the U-boat began shelling the ship, setting her on fire and left the wreck in sinking condition. The ship finally sank in position 03°09'N, 04°15'E. One crew member was lost. The master, 101 crew members, eight gunners and 112 passengers were picked up by the British destroyer HMS Boadicea (Lt.Cdr. F.C. Brodrick, RN) and the British sloop HMS Bridgewater (Cdr. N.W.H. Weekes, OBE, RN) and landed at Takoradi. Media links British destroyers & frigatesNorman Friedman Destroyers of World War TwoWhitley, M. J.

Kingdon, RN) and the Polish destroyer Grom (Lt.Cdr. A. Hulewicz, ORP) were ordered to leave Harwich and establish a patrol in the North Sea. Shortly before that, a German He 59 seaplane dropped two magnetic mines nearby, but there was no time for searching. HMS Gipsy hit one of those mines which tore her into two pieces. Most of the survivors were picked up by HMS Griffin and HMS Keith. Media links British destroyers & frigatesNorman Friedman Destroyers of World War TwoWhitley, M. J.

Примечания[вироиш] ↑ Google Maps has introduced a reverse-geocoding feature, which gives priority to the closest object in their database, instead of the desired coordinates. The closest object is shown with a bright red marker with the map centered on it, and the requested coordinates are given a green marker that often blends into the background or is outside the displayed area. It might be called the "you must have meant this" feature. Our use of the Google Maps KML generator for Google Earth links is also affected. That's not something that can be fixed here. read more...

<TEXT> Cargo ship From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2008) The Colombo Express, one of the largest container ships in the world (when she was built in 2005), owned and operated by Hapag-Lloyd of Germany Cargo fleet in 2006 A cargo ship or freighter is any sort of ship or vessel that carries cargo, goods, and materials from one port to another. Thousands of cargo carriers ply the world's seas and oceans each year, handling the bulk of international trade. Cargo ships are usually specially designed for the task, often being equipped with cranes and other mechanisms to load and unload, and come in all sizes. Today, they are almost always built of welded steel, and with some exceptions generally have a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years before being scrapped.[citation needed] Contents 1 Types 2 History 3 Piracy 4 Definitions 5 Vessel prefixes 6 Famous cargo ships 7 Controversies 8 See also 9 References 9.1 Notes 9.2 Bibliography 10 External links Types[edit] Loading of a general cargo vessel in 1959 Cargo ships/freighters can be divided into five groups, according to the type of cargo they carry. These groups are: General cargo vessels Tankers Dry bulk carriers Multi-purpose vessels Reefer ships General cargo vessels carry packaged items like chemicals, foods, furniture, machinery, motor- and military vehicles, footwear, garments, etc. Tankers carry petroleum products or other liquid cargo. Dry bulk carriers carry coal, grain, ore and other similar products in loose form. Multi-purpose vessels, as the name suggests, carry different classes of cargo – e.g. liquid and general cargo – at the same time. A Reefer (or Refrigerated) ship is specifically designed[1] and used for shipping perishable commodities which require temperature-controlled, mostly fruits, meat, fish, vegetables, dairy products and other foodstuffs. Specialized types of cargo vessels include container ships and bulk carriers (technically tankers of all sizes are cargo ships, although they are routinely thought of as a separate category). Cargo ships fall into two further categories that reflect the services they offer to industry: liner and tramp services. Those on a fixed published schedule and fixed tariff rates are cargo liners. Tramp ships do not have fixed schedules. Users charter them to haul loads. Generally, the smaller shipping companies and private individuals operate tramp ships. Cargo liners run on fixed schedules published by the shipping companies. Each trip a liner takes is called a voyage. Liners mostly carry general cargo. However, some cargo liners may carry passengers also. A cargo liner that carries 12 or more passengers is called a combination or passenger-cum-cargo line. History[edit] The earliest records of waterborne activity mention the carriage of items for trade; the evidence of history and archaeology shows the practice to be widespread by the beginning of the 1st millennium BC, and as early as the 14th and 15th centuries BC small Mediterranean cargo ships like those of the 50 foot long (15 - 16 metre) Uluburun ship were carrying 20 tons of exotic cargo; 11 tons of raw copper, jars, glass, ivory, gold, spices, and treasures from Canaan, Greece, Egypt, and Africa. The desire to operate trade routes over longer distances, and throughout more seasons of the year, motivated improvements in ship design during the Middle Ages. Before the middle of the 19th century, the incidence of piracy resulted in most cargo ships being armed, sometimes quite heavily, as in the case of the Manila galleons and East Indiamen. They were also sometimes escorted by warships. Piracy[edit] Further information: Piracy Piracy is still quite common in some waters, particularly in the Malacca Straits, a narrow channel between Indonesia and Singapore / Malaysia, and cargo ships are still commonly targeted. In 2004, the governments of those three nations agreed to provide better protection for the ships passing through the Straits. The waters off Somalia and Nigeria are also prone to piracy, while smaller vessels are also in danger along parts of the South American, Southeast Asian coasts and near the Caribbean Sea.[2][3] Definitions[edit] A Delmas container ship unloading at the Zanzibar port in Tanzania The words cargo and freight have become interchangeable in casual usage. Technically, "cargo" refers to the goods carried aboard the ship for hire, while "freight" refers to the compensation the ship or charterer receives for carrying the cargo. Generally, the modern ocean shipping business is divided into two classes: Liner business: typically (but not exclusively) container vessels (wherein "general cargo" is carried in 20 or 40-foot containers), operating as "common carriers", calling a regularly published schedule of ports. A common carrier refers to a regulated service where any member of the public may book cargo for shipment, according to long-established and internationally agreed rules. Tramp-tanker business: generally this is private business arranged between the shipper and receiver and facilitated by the vessel owners or operators, who offer their vessels for hire to carry bulk (dry or liquid) or break bulk (cargoes with individually handled pieces) to any suitable port(s) in the world, according to a specifically drawn contract, called a charter party. Larger cargo ships are generally operated by shipping lines: companies that specialize in the handling of cargo in general. Smaller vessels, such as coasters, are often owned by their operators. Vessel prefixes[edit] A category designation appears before the vessel's name. A few examples of prefixes for naval ships are "USS" (United States Ship), "HMS" (Her/His Majesty's Ship), "HMCS" (Her/His majesty's Canadian Ship) and "HTMS" (His Thai Majesty's Ship), while a few examples for prefixes for merchant ships are "RMS" (Royal Mail Ship, usually a passenger liner), "MV" (Motor Vessel, powered by Diesel), "MT" (Motor Tanker, powered vessel carrying liquids only) "FV" Fishing Vessel and "SS" (Screw Streamer, driven by propellers or screws, often understood to stand for Steamship). "TS", sometimes found in first position before a merchant ship's prefix, denotes that it is a Turbine Steamer. (For further discussion, see Ship prefixes.) Famous cargo ships[edit] Famous cargo ships include the Liberty ships of World War II, partly based on a British design. Liberty ship sections were prefabricated in locations across the USA and then assembled by shipbuilders in an average of six weeks, with the record being just over four days. These ships allowed the Allies to replace sunken cargo vessels at a rate greater than the Kriegsmarine's U-boats could sink them, and contributed significantly to the war effort, the delivery of supplies, and eventual victory over the Axis powers. Lake freighters built for the Great Lakes in North America differ in design from sea water going ships because of the difference in wave size and frequency in the lakes. A number of these boats are so large that they cannot leave the lakes because they do not fit into the locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Cargo ships are categorized partly by capacity, partly by weight, and partly by dimensions (often with reference to the various canals and canal locks they fit through). Common categories include: Dry Cargo Small Handy size, carriers of 20,000 long tons deadweight (DWT)-28,000 DWT Handy size, carriers of 28,000-40,000 DWT Seawaymax, the largest size that can traverse the St Lawrence Seaway Handymax, carriers of 40,000-50,000 DWT Panamax, the largest size that can traverse the Panama Canal (generally: vessels with a width smaller than 32.2 m) Limited to 52,000 DWT loaded, 80,000 DWT empty. New Panamax, Upgraded Panama locks with 55m beam, 18M depth, 120,000 DWT[4] Capesize, vessels larger than Panamax and Post-Panamax, and must traverse the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn to travel between oceans Chinamax, carriers of 380,000-400,000 DWT with main dimensions limited by port infrastructure in China Wet Cargo Aframax, oil tankers between 75,000 and 115,000 DWT. This is the largest size defined by the average freight rate assessment (AFRA) scheme. Suezmax, the largest size that can traverse the Suez Canal VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier), supertankers between 150,000 and 320,000 DWT. Malaccamax, the largest size that can traverse the Strait of Malacca ULCC (Ultra Large Crude Carrier), enormous supertankers between 320,000 and 550,000 DWT Controversies[edit] Due to its low cost, most large cargo vessels are powered by bunker fuel also known as Heavy Fuel Oil which contains higher sulphur levels than diesel.[5] This level of pollution is accelerating:[6] with bunker fuel consumption at 278 million tonnes per year in 2001, it is projected to be at 500 million tonnes per year in 2020.[7] International standards to dramatically reduce sulphur content in marine fuels and nitrogen oxide emissions have been put in place. Among some of the solutions offered is changing over the fuel intake to clean diesel or marine gas oil, while in restricted waters and Cold Ironing the ship while it is in port. If the various requirements are enforced, the International Maritime Organization's marine fuel requirement will mean a 90% reduction in sulphur oxide emissions;[8] whilst the European Union is planning stricter controls on emissions.[9] See also[edit] Nautical portal Wikimedia Commons has media related to General cargo ships.
